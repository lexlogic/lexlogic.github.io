In what appears to be a new trend for cybercrime groups, India's largest integrated power company, Tata Power Ltd., confirmed on Friday that it had been the target of a cyber attack.

This is the latest in a recent string of attacks against national infrastructure. [Last week](https://logicsec.io/2022/10/us-airports-taken-down-in-ddos-attacks-by-pro-russian-hackers/), we saw US airports being targeted by pro-Russian cybercrime groups, taking several airlines offline for several hours.

In a [filing](https://archives.nseindia.com/corporate/TATAPOWER_14102022190039_SELetter.pdf) to the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE), the company said the IT infrastructure breach affected "part of its IT systems". It further said it had taken steps to retrieve and recover the affected machines, adding that it had put a security fence on its customer-facing portal to prevent unauthorized access. 

The Mumbai-based energy company, which is part of the Tata Group, did not provide any further details on the nature or timing of the attack.

In April, cybersecurity firm Recorded Future disclosed attacks mounted by China-linked adversaries targeting Indian power grid organizations.

The network intrusions are said to have been aimed at "at least seven Indian State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) responsible for carrying out real-time operations for grid control and electricity dispatch within these respective states."

The attacks were attributed to an emerging threat cluster Recorded Future tracking under Threat Activity Group 38 (TAG-38).

The company further assessed that the goal is to facilitate the collection of information related to critical infrastructure assets or may be a precursor to future activity.

China denied the allegations that it was involved in the attack, stating that "many of U.S. allies or countries with which it cooperates on cybersecurity are also victims of U.S. cyberattacks."
