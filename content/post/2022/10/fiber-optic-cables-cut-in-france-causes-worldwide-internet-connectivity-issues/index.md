A major Internet cable in the South of France was severed on October 19th at 20:30 UTC, impacting subsea cable connectivity to Europe, Asia, and the United States and causing data packet losses and increased website response latency.

Zscaler has reported they are working to make adjustments to mitigate the impact of the outage. Multiple application and content providers will still be unavailable with these mitigations in place. 

"Zscaler is working with the content providers to have them influence their portion of the path," reads [a notice](https://trust.zscaler.com/zscloud.net/posts/12256) from Zscaler.

"If you experience slowness with specific applications, especially applications hosted overseas, please contact the application provider and refer them to this trust post."

Repair crews were on-site quickly but due to the nature of the cut, police requested the teams wait until evidence could be collected from the site. 

**10/19/2022 23:00 UTC:** it was confirmed that the incident had impacted three links: Marseille-Lyon, Marseille-Milano, and Marseille-Barcelona.

**10/20/2022 01:00 UTC:** when Zscaler's repair crews restored one of the links, but the technicians continued observing packet losses and latency for some destinations.

**10/20/2022 18:58:01 UTC:** Zscaler posted a final update stating the issue has been resolved.

"This incident has been resolved. Please contact Zscaler Support if you have additional questions." - Zscaler.



## Cable damages in the UK too

[BCC has reported](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-63326102) that a subsea cable linking the Shetland Islands to the Scottish mainland has been damaged, as well, leaving the island isolated from the rest of the world. 

The outage also impacted emergency services, prompting authorities to request citizens to not make any calls to allow the few lines available to be open for emergency communications, [according to Scottish Police](https://www.scotland.police.uk/what-s-happening/news/2022/october/outage-affecting-landlines-mobile-phones-and-internet-shetland/). 

This incident comes as technicians were already working on fixing the link between the Faroe Islands and Shetland, which was also severed last week.

Faroese Telecom's head of infrastructure Páll Vesturbú told the BBC that the cable cuts are believed to have been done by fishing vessels, though it's unusual to have two incidents simultaneously.

"We expect it will be fishing vessels that damaged the cable but it is very rare that we have two problems at the same time," Vesturbú told the BBC.

Investigations into these recent incidents are still underway, and there is nothing at this time that indicates these are acts of sabotage.
