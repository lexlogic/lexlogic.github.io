**Enterprise communications firm Twilio has concluded its investigation into the recent data breach and revealed on Thursday that its employees were targeted in smishing and vishing attacks on two separate occasions.**

Twilio disclosed on August 7 that it had discovered illegal access to user account information a few days earlier. According to an investigation, the breach was caused by an SMS phishing (smishing) attempt that was directed at the company's employees.

A few weeks after Cloudflare announced that it had also been targeted, it was discovered that the two companies had been singled out as part of an extensive phishing campaign that had affected over 130 enterprises.

It seems that the attackers were looking for financial gain.

Twilio has nowÂ [concluded its investigation](https://www.twilio.com/blog/august-2022-social-engineering-attack). Only 209 of the company's more than 270,000 customers and 93 of the 75 million Authy end-user accounts were affected, according to the company, which claims the attackers were shut out of its systems on August 9. There is no proof that the threat actors had access to API keys, authentication tokens, or client console account credentials for Twilio.

According to Twilio's final assessment, the same threat actor was probably also in charge of an attack against the company in late June. It was a "brief security incident," according to the company, that involved voice phishing (vishing). The attackers employed social engineering to get an employee to reveal their credentials, which they then exploited to gain access to a small number of customers' contact information.

According to Twilio, the hackers' access was found and terminated in less than 12 hours. Early in July, affected individuals received notifications informing them of the access.

The mid-July smishing campaign, which entailed sending hundreds of text messages to the phones of current and former Twilio employees, was the cause of the breach that was discovered in August. The emails instructed recipients to click a link that would take them to a bogus Okta login page and claimed to be from IT managers.

Some workers fell into the trap and entered their login information on phishing websites. Using these credentials, the hackers were able to access internal software and tools, which gave them access to specific client data.
