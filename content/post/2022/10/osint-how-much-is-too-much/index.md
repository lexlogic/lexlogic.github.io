In my former life, I paid my bills working as a covert police officer. This sounds a bit flippant, but it took years of hard work, horrific experiences, death, and destruction, witnessing pain and suffering, and a lot of petrol station food but the results were, I became an actor in a soap opera where the next episode could well be your swan song.

I spent the majority of the time just watching. I learned how people work. Their behaviors, movements, and tells, all told me a story of who they were. Further, into my career, I got to move on from being the watcher to being the doer. I was finally deployed! I was now able to move about in the streets putting my observing skills to practice with real social engineering tests with high stakes involved.

This work is what really got me interested in Humans and what makes them tick. How you can make someone do something by manipulating a situation or misrepresenting yourself.  The game went from “How can I make this career criminal take me under their wing” to the private sector with the goal of “How can I make this person give me access to the server room”.  I won't go into the war stories where I probably remember things being more heroic and dangerous than they actually were, what I want to ask is the ethical questions surrounding social engineering in the private sector.

A basic test for me now follows a fairly prescribed formula:

* Introduction and sales call 
* Scoping exercise
* Submit proposal
* Win work
* Carry out recon
* Complete test
* Report
* Chase payment

This is a process a lot of you might recognize. The parts that really started to play on my mind were the recon and the testing pieces.

I recently needed to gain access to a building as part of a physical security test. During the OSINT phase of recon, I learned that the front of the house was a real dog person. I mean a REAL dog person, as in Dogs were their life! Sadly, one of their dogs had recently passed away. As a social engineer, this is perfectly solid information. A conversation starter if you will. This can help someone gain confidence in you, perhaps even empathize with a similar situation you might tell them about, and ultimately gain more trust in you.

When looking at how I wanted to conduct the assessment, I planned it as follows:

On the day of the test, I would arrive in the morning rush at 08:45 and approach the front desk

Me - “Hi, my card won’t work again I’ve been here for a week now and it’s still not sorted” I would reach inside my jacket for my wallet “excuse all the fur on my jacket, I try to lint roll it off but my dogs are shedding faster than I can roll”

This would invoke a conversation about dogs. Now, remember I know all about the marks Dog. I know the breed, the age, their favorite toy, the weekends away, the lot! Now I can insert certain bits of information in the conversation that will give a sense of familiarity between my “dogs” and the marks dogs. We can share stories and ownership tips and eventually move on to my “recent bereavement” where my soul mate “Skipper the German shepherd” had passed away from a heart defect.

What do you know? The marks dog met the same fate, same breed, same age, same fate. Boom the trust is formed. I now have the best possible chance to get past the front desk and into the building. I might even score a guest pass that I can clone and hand back giving me access for a few days to come. 

This was brilliant, I thought. A perfect way into the building. Don’t feel bad because after all, a bad guy would happily use any method to trick their way in. After all your job is to identify vulnerabilities and exploit them.  But then I looked over at my Dog (not called Skipper by the way) and I had a moment: The front of the house never signed up for this.  They didn’t join a company in order to be manipulated and used. What if this event is the final straw, the thing that pushes them over the edge? They thought they were over the loss of their dog but then suddenly even at work, it's there. With everything else that could be going on in their life, this is the final straw.  Is that a price we are really willing to pay? Is that a company looking after its staff? Is this me being able to retain the title of Ethical hacker?

So you got into the building. What if the staff member you are targeting is out sick? What if other members of the staff learn about the test and how you exploited the poor front of the house to gain access? What if what you are doing causes staff morale to drop and the words "toxic workplace" start to be thrown about? What if the reviews start pouring in talking about how everyone's favorite front-of-house superstar has been manipulated to the point where they are calling out sick or worse? Was it worth it?

But then you need to look at the other side of this. The location is meant to be secure and house sensitive data. Bad actors will happily use the techniques above to gain entry regardless of the damage done to company morale. What if they gain access to the servers and plant malware that ruins the lives of the employees? Families are torn apart, wages suffering for those who remain, secrets stolen, and potential customer business ruined. Hospitals, schools, and homes are all affected, just by a single physical security breach. The results could be catastrophic.

It’s a perfect storm, damned if you do and damned if you don't.  We need to keep our businesses safe, we need to maintain our supply chain security. We also need to look after each other, we must care about our staff.

The solution, in this case, was simple, it was role-playing training and attack simulation with the FULL consent of identified staff, we had a good time in the end. We pulled up the staff's social media pages and highlighted information that could be used against them or the business. We looked at company protocols and rewrote some policies. We even order pizza for lunch but the issue still remains: we have strict guidelines and methodologies when it comes to technology but still not a single coherent standard when it comes to exploiting humans.

The biggest risk will always be humans. Our exploitable characteristics come from our loyalties and ideologies. Our moral compass is often calibrated way before we hit the employment market. We are affected by other humans in a way machines never can be. We can be strong one day and fall to pieces the next. We can care absolutely and hate indefinitely.

A pentest can finish, a report can be issued, remedial advice gets offered and the machine doesn't care either way (yet). A black team operation can finish and the results can affect a real human for the rest of their life.

This is why I work tirelessly on what I believe will be the industry standard. A certification guided by morals and principals, taking humans into account. The CTL of physical security testing and I hope one day we can have the same consistency for this method of security testing as there is for infrastructures and applications.

But for now, Before you give the green light to social engineers ask yourself, how much is too much?
