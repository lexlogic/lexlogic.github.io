Data-driven decision-making has become a popular trend in business, with 68% of organizations either implementing or planning data-driven projects within the next year, according to research from Foundry. While being data-driven can bring numerous benefits, such as better decision-making and new product development, it's important for businesses to prioritize data security and privacy in order to avoid fines and regulatory penalties.

One example is Sephora, which was the first company to be fined for violating the California Consumer Privacy Act. Instagram also faced a fine of over $400 million in Ireland for misusing children's data. In Indonesia, data operators who misuse information could even face jail time.

To avoid these risks, it's crucial for businesses to develop a data security governance strategy that prioritizes security, governance, privacy, and compliance. This is especially important for larger organizations, but smaller businesses can also benefit from a well-thought-out plan. A data security governance strategy can lead to better business outcomes and user experiences, as well as improved trust and credibility with customers.



### Understanding Compliance Requirements

To ensure consistency and compliance across all data operations and systems, organizations need a comprehensive, scalable framework for security and governance. This becomes especially important when dealing with personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data.

For example, if you have PII in an on-premises database that different business groups share, you need to be able to enforce policies that protect that data. Different teams may have other purposes for accessing the data, so their privileges to access that data should be defined by their purpose.

However, managing data security and governance becomes increasingly complex as data volumes grow, the shapes of data become more diverse (structured and unstructured), and deployment models become more varied (on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud). In addition, regional regulations can further complicate the ability to set global security and access policies and enforce them consistently. Finally, different systems may have different ways of defining security, governance, and policies, making it difficult to establish a universal approach to compliance.



### Creating a global security and governance framework

With 97% of organizations expecting their data to grow rapidly over the next five years, it's no surprise that maintaining security and compliance is their top concern (63%), according to a [report](https://hubspot.ocient.com/hubfs/Tech%20Papers/Ocient%20-%20The%20Rise%20Of%20Hyperscale.pdf) from Ocient. To address this issue, data security governance strategies can be helpful.

The first step in this process is to identify and classify all of an organization's data, regardless of its location or shape. Once data is classified, certain PII and sensitive data fields may need to be individually encrypted in order to meet compliance and security requirements. Access policies must then be implemented to ensure that only personnel with the appropriate privileges can access the data they need for their tasks. Cybersecurity teams should have fine-grained access controls based on persona to prevent any user from having overly broad permissions to access data.

As organizations scale to terabytes and petabytes of data, it becomes increasingly difficult or even impossible to manage data security and governance manually. To avoid this, it's important for chief data officers, chief privacy officers, and CIOs to develop a comprehensive data security governance strategy. This shared responsibility requires a common understanding of how data is stored, accessed, processed, and shared with multiple parties and entities, both internally and externally. A comprehensive data governance and security framework will allow for continuous compliance audits and strict data access monitoring at scale.



### Improving business outcomes in real time

A comprehensive governance and security strategy is essential for monetizing data assets, improving existing products, and creating new experiences. This is because utilizing data often requires combining it with datasets from other parties or various heterogeneous data sources.

For example, Nike collects data from smart device applications, but in order to turn that data into valuable insights and improve the customer experience, it needs a governance strategy that ensures compliance with end-user security and privacy requirements.

The faster an organization can ingest and secure data, the sooner data engineers, analysts, or scientists can turn available datasets into actionable insights for businesses. With a scalable strategy for preserving privacy and security, businesses can tap into new markets that were previously out of reach due to strict compliance requirements.

If a security function tries to patch together a security and governance strategy manually or as an afterthought, it could take weeks or months before relevant data is usable and available, assuming there are no mistakes along the way. In a fast-moving, data-driven world, this delay could cause the data to become outdated and unusable.

Compliance regulations, the need for a strong security posture, and data privacy are only going to increase in the coming years. To stay ahead of the curve, modern, data-centric organizations are investing in comprehensive, scalable data security and governance strategies.

### Final Thoughts

In conclusion, data security and governance is an essential consideration for businesses looking to monetize their data assets, improve their products, and create new experiences. By developing a comprehensive, scalable strategy for preserving privacy and security, businesses can ensure compliance with regulations and better protect their valuable data assets. This will allow them to take full advantage of their data and respond quickly to changing market conditions. Investing in a strong data security and governance strategy is a key step toward success in today's data-driven world.
