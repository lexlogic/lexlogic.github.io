I can wear many hats within the Information Technology field, but my true passion lies in Information Security. I am extremely challenge, goal, and passion driven. I enjoy complex investigations and analysis that push me to my limits and ultimately grow me. I love being in a collaborative team environment, but am very capable of peeling from the group to work independently. In my free time I like to create virtual lab environments for security issues that I am interested in gaining a deeper understanding of how to detect and protect people from them.

I tend to thrive in Active Directory environments and love to ensure systems are running the best they can. I am always trying to improve the networks I work on and ensure that my company is getting the best out of me.
